Wav2Lip Lip Sync Code
This code allows you to synchronize an audio track with a video of a person speaking, creating a lip-synced video.

Prerequisites
Google Colab account (for running this code in a Colab environment)
Python 3.x
Setup
Clone the Wav2Lip repository and navigate to the appropriate directory:

shell
Copy code
!git clone https://github.com/justinjohn0306/Wav2Lip
Download the pre-trained models:

shell
Copy code
!wget 'https://github.com/justinjohn0306/Wav2Lip/releases/download/models/wav2lip.pth' -O 'checkpoints/wav2lip.pth'
!wget 'https://github.com/justinjohn0306/Wav2Lip/releases/download/models/wav2lip_gan.pth' -O 'checkpoints/wav2lip_gan.pth'
!wget 'https://github.com/justinjohn0306/Wav2Lip/releases/download/models/resnet50.pth' -O 'checkpoints/resnet50.pth'
!wget 'https://github.com/justinjohn0306/Wav2Lip/releases/download/models/mobilenet.pth' -O 'checkpoints/mobilenet.pth'
Install required packages:

shell
Copy code
!pip install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AwaleSajil/ghc/master/ghc-1.0-py3-none-any.whl
!pip install git+https://github.com/elliottzheng/batch-face.git@master
!pip install ffmpeg-python mediapipe==0.8.11
!pip install yt-dlp
Remove the sample data folder (if it exists):

shell
Copy code
!rm -rf /content/sample_data
!mkdir /content/sample_data
Usage
Provide the YouTube video URL from which you want to extract the audio.
Trim the video by specifying the start and end times to ensure there's a face in all frames.
Select your audio source (record, upload from a local drive, or Google Drive).
Configure optional parameters for video processing (e.g., padding, smoothing, model selection).
Run the code, and the lip-synced video will be generated.
Example
Here's an example Colab notebook that demonstrates how to use this code: Colab Notebook

Output
The lip-synced video will be saved as results/result_voice.mp4. You can download it from the Colab environment.
